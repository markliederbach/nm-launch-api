Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up nm_launch_api for local development.

1. Clone you the project on Gitlab locally::

    $ git clone https://github.com/markliederbach/nm-launch-catalog.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    $ mkvirtualenv nm_launch_api-dev
    $ cd nm_launch_api/
    $ pip install -U .

4. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b feature-name-your-branch

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8 and the tests, including testing other Python versions with tox::

    $ flake8 nm_launch_api tests
    $ python setup.py test
    $ tox

   To get flake8 and tox, just pip install them into your virtualenv.

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to Gitlab::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin feature-name-your-branch

7. Submit a merge request through the Gitlab website.

Merge Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a merge request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The merge request should include tests.
2. If the merge request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.rst.
3. The merge request should work for Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, and 3.4, and for PyPy.

Tips
----

To run a subset of tests::

    $ python -m unittest tests.test_nm_launch_api
